Peer-to-peer approaches to anonymous communication promise to eliminate the scalability concerns and central vulnerability points of current networks such as Tor. However, the P2P setting introduces many new opportunities for attack, and previous designs do not provide an adequate level of anonymity. We propose ShadowWalker: a new low-latency P2P anonymous ...
P2P systems rely on directory services for locating peers with the desired content and services. Directory services are themselves decentralized, such as with distributed hash tables (DHTs) that allow for efficient locating of objects without a centralized directory. As a system distributed over a diverse set of untrusted nodes, however, ...
We analyze information leaks in the lookup mechanisms of structured peer-to-peer anonymous communication systems and how these leaks can be used to compromise anonymity. We show that the techniques that are used to combat active attacks on the lookup mechanism dramatically increase information leaks and increase the efficacy of passive ...
BitTorrent protocol incentivizes sharing through its choking algorithm. BitTorrent choking algorithm creates clusters of leechers with similar upload capacity to achieve higher overall transfer rates. We show that a malicious peer can exploit BitTorrent's choking algorithm to reduce the upload utilization of high bandwidth leechers. We use a testbed comprising ...
Tor, a distributed Internet anonymizing system, relies on volunteers who run dedicated relays. Other than altruism, these volunteers have no incentive to run relays, causing a large disparity between the number of users and available relays. We introduce BRAIDS, a set of practical mechanisms that encourages users to run Tor ...
This paper studies the problem of resource discovery in unstructured peer-to-peer (P2P) systems.

Many anonymous peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing systems have been proposed in recent years. One problem that remains open is how to protect the anonymity of all participating users, namely, reader, server and publisher. In this work we propose a novel solution for a P2P file sharing system. Our solution provides ...
The ability to locate random relays is a key challenge for peer-to-peer (P2P) anonymous communication systems. Earlier attempts like Salsa and AP3 used distributes hash table lookups to locate relays, but the lack of anonymity in their lookup mechanisms enables an adversary to infer the path structure and compromise used ...
We introduce Torsk, a structured peer-to-peer low-latency anonymity protocol. Torsk is designed as an interoperable replacement for the relay selection and directory service of the popular Tor anonymity network, that decreases the bandwidth cost of relay selection and maintenance from quadratic to quasilinear while introducing no new attacks on the ...
In Peer-to-Peer (P2P) computing environments, each participant (peer) acts as both client and content provider. This satisfies the requirement that resources should be increasingly made available by being published to other users from a user's machine. Compared with services performed by the client-server model, P2P-based services have several advantages. However, ...
Traditional mix-based systems are composed of a small set of static, well known, and highly reliable mixes. To resist traffic analysis attacks at a mix, cover traffic must be used, which results in significant bandwidth overhead. End-to-end traffic analysis attacks are even more difficult to counter because there are only ...
Peer-to-peer (P2P) applications have seen an enormous success, and recently introduced P2P services have reached tens of millions of users. A feature that significantly contributes to the success of many P2P applications is user anonymity. However, anonymity opens the door to possible misuses and abuses, exploiting the P2P network as ...

# Academic Paper Search Documentation

## prompt

At the end of the semester, each team must submit the software code produced for the project to an open source repository (github) along with a written documentation. The documentation should consist of the following elements: 1) An overview of the function of the code (i.e., what it does and what it can be used for). 2) Documentation of how the software is implemented with sufficient detail so that others can have a basic understanding of your code for future extension or any further improvement. 3) Documentation of the usage of the software including either documentation of usages of APIs or detailed instructions on how to install and run a software, whichever is applicable. 4) Brief description of contribution of each team member in case of a multi-person team. Note that if you are in a team, it is your responsibility to figure out how to contribute to your group project, so you will need to act proactively and in a timely manner if your group coordinator has not assigned a task to you. There will be no opportunity to make up for any task that you failed to accomplish. In general, all the members of a team will get the same grade for the project unless the documentation submission indicates that some member(s) only superficially participated in the project without doing much actual work; in that case, we will discount the grade. Everyone is expected to spend at least 20 hours to seriously work on your course project as a minimum, not including the time spent for preparing the documentation.

The 20% for the documentation submission includes 5% for overview of functions, 10% for implementation documentation, 5% for usage documentation.

## overview

This search engine provides 

This tool will be a search engine that will find relevant academic papers, given a specific field in computer science. In addition, the results will link the user to other academic papers that it cites and also other papers that cite the results.
Students and faculty interested in a specific research area will be able to have a more narrowed search. Because it leads to related papers, people are able to search through webs of results rather than just a list.
This tool is similar to the expert finding tools and other academic based search engines, however it is different because we are supplying papers on very specific subject areas instead of giving the users vague resources. People would care about this difference because they would have more specific resources to use.

## overview

This search engine allows students and faculty to find relevant academic papers given a specific field. The user is prompted to select a topic from a drop down menu and a query. The engine then returns the top results for this query. The tool allows for a more narrow and more thorough search that ranks articles on relevance and credibility.

## implementation details

**Corpus:**  
To build a corpus of relevant articles, the algorithm uses `beautiful soup` to scrape multiple ACM Digital Library sources to build a dictionary of article information.   

**Ranking:**    
Using the corpus, the search engine then builds a file containing all the abstracts and article times. After creating an inverted index for the documents, `BM25` is used to rank the two individually to produce a list of the most relevant documents. To take into account credibility, the algorithm sorts the documents by citation and download count as well. Using these ranks, each document is assigned a score as follows:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. documents corresponding to the top 20 relevant abstracts will have `(20 - rank) * 0.40)` added to their score.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. documents corresponding to the top 20 relevant titles will have `(20-rank) * 0.40` added to their score.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. documents corresponding to the top 20 highest citation count will have `(20 - rank) * 0.10` added to their score.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. documents corresponding to the top 20 highest document count will have `(20 - rank) * 0.10` added to their score.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where rank is defined as where they fall on the respective top 20 lists.   

**Front End:**  
HTML & CSS was used to develop a search engine front end. Flask was used to connect the Python scripts to the HTML to have an interactive front end for the product.  

`getScores(query, topic)` is the overarching wrapper function that takes the passed in user query string and the corresponding topic integer to create a corpus, rank the articles, and return a sorted list of the top ten relevant articles for the given query.  

More documentation on each function can be seen in the respective Python files where  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; parse.py performs the web scraping  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; searching.py performs the necessary rankings  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ranking.py assigns the scores  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; views.py uses Flask to connect the HTML to the Python  

The topics are numbered as follows:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Software Foundations  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Algorithms and Models of Computation  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Intelligence and Big Data  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Human and Social Impact  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Media  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Scientific, Parallel, and High Performance Computing  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. Distributed Systems, Networking, and Security  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. Machines  

## software usage

The following packages need to be installed for the program:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flask  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bs4  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lxml  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; metapy  
This can be done through `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  

To start the application, use `python run.py` and open the browser to the url provided by Flask. To run a search, enter any query and choose a topic from the drop down menu. On the results page, selecting an entry will redirect the user to a download link.  

**Examples of Queries to Run:**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "vertex cover", Algorithms and Models of Computation  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "interactive tutoring system", Human & Social Impact  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "graphics processing unit", Machines  

## contribution breakdown

The work was split evenly among group members. The following table shows a very brief breakdown of each group memberâ€™s contribution to the project.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Ria Nair:** developed front-end and connected to Python scripts using Flask  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Ann Rajan:** developed ranking algorithm & created demo script  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Kavya Varghese:** developed web scraping & ranking algorithm & created demo video
